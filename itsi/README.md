### Relationships
#### Dependencies:
Services are interconnected; for instance, System Health Monitoring is dependent on Data Collection, Event Monitoring, Performance Metrics, Error Logs, Update and Patch Status, User Activity, and Integration Health. Similarly, Event Monitoring relies on Notifications and Event Data, Watchlist Hit Notifications, Feed Hit Notifications, New Binary Instance Notifications, Binary File Upload Complete Notifications, and Raw Endpoint Events.

#### Hierarchical Structure:
Some services form a hierarchy, such as Data Collection depending on Data Ingestion Configuration and Verification of Data Ingestion, illustrating a layered approach to performance monitoring where base metrics support broader performance indicators.
